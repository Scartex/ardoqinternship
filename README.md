# Weatherbot (2c)
-----Sample conversation----
User: Hello!
Bot: Hello! I'll help you with the weather, try asking things like "weather forecast in Oslo tomorrow" and I'll do my best to help you ;)
User: what is your name?
Bot: My name is weatherbot, what is yours?
User: Oskar
Bot: Nice to meet you Oskar!
User: weather in Oslo tomorrow
Bot: Current conditions in the City Oslo, Norway are Partly cloudy with a projected high of 11째C or 52째F and a low of 5째C or 42째F on 2018-04-17.

---Why I chose this framework----
I wanted to create a chatbot because I thought it was a really interesting task and is in a area that I'd like to develop my skills in. At first I wanted to try
out superscript, since I wasn't really familiar with any of the frameworks/services I thought I would just pick one. I struggled for quite some time trying to set up 
superscript, but it was littered with bugs and erros that I suspect stem from the compatibility with Windows 10. Therefore I decided to scrap my Superscript 
project and decided to try out dialogflow instead. This worked a lot better and I didn't really meet any hard challenges, so that's why I decided to focus fully on 
the dialogflow project. 


---How to use----
To use the bot, simply enter this website:
https://bot.dialogflow.com/e569b05d-41d6-4b00-bc1d-aed32f2d21b0

Some background: The bot is using a public API from worldweatheronline that gives updated information about the weather from cities around the world. 
So recieve this information you can use different command, for example: "weather forecast in Oslo for tomorrow". 
You can also ask the bot for it's name where it will ask for your name as well. 

I will also include the JavaScript code in the github repository where you will also find the file for task 1.
